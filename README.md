Presently, I work as a mental health therapist full-time. When I want to try a new intervention/idea with a client, I have to find a worksheet or online resource, 
print it, and (if I like it enough) file it in a filing cabinet. I've wanted a way to automate this process, a way to store these resources in an online website 
or resource to streamline this. Enter TherapyVault. This is my attempt to solve this problem
